-- | In Andras Kovacs's original paper, intensional pattern matching on code
-- is not allowed, but it is allowed in Template Haskell and can be used
-- for example to implement this @codeApp@ such that @codeApp xs [|| [] ||]@
-- equals @xs@ (rather than @[|| $$xs ++ [] ||]@). We don't essentially rely on
-- this but it is handy in a few places for generating better-looking code.

-- * Operations specialised for `CodeQ`.
--
-- Sometimes GHC has a hard time of inferring the type of operations like
-- @put [|| ... ||]@ because the quotation by default has type @Code m@.
-- So having some specialised operations is sometimes handy.
